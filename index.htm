    <h1>JIYA SHAH</h1>
    <h2>A curious mind always finds its path.</h2>
    <h2>A human behind the screen, building with passion.</h2>
    <h2>Failing once? Human. Trying again?.</h2>
    <h2>Code by day, dream by night.</h2>
    <h2>In a world full of noise, creation is peace.</h2>
    <h2>Passion isn't loud — it builds, line by line..</h2>
    <h2>Behind each repo is a real person, trying.</h2>
    <h2>One push today, one future changed tomorrow.</h2>
    <h2>The human touch makes even machines come alive.</h2>
    <h2>HTML may describe a page — but we write the meaning.</h2>
